<h3 id="Exercise_1.1:_Tag-control_subtraction">Exercise 1.1: Tag-control subtraction</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><p class="line862">The first (and simplest) thing to do with the data is tag-control subtraction to get a perfusion weighted image. This can be achieved with <tt class="backtick">asl_file</tt>: <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><pre><span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span>asl_file --data=data --ntis=1 --iaf=tc --diff --out=diffdata --mean=diffdata_mean</pre><span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><p class="line862">Note that we have told <tt class="backtick">asl_file</tt> that the data contains only a single delay (<tt class="backtick">--ntis=1</tt>), that we have tag and control pairs (<tt class="backtick">--iaf=tc</tt> - standing for input ASL format). We have asked asl_file to perform tag control differencing (<tt class="backtick">--diff</tt>) and then output to a file called <tt class="backtick">diffdata</tt>, we have also asked for a second output in mean the mean has been taken across all the repeats in the data (<tt class="backtick">--mean=diffdata_mean</tt>).  If you examine the <tt class="backtick">diffdata_mean</tt> image you should see something that looks like an image of perfusion. In fact if we were happy with relative perfusion values we could stop here. <span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><p class="line867">
<h3 id="Exercise_1.2:_Kinetic_model_inversion">Exercise 1.2: Kinetic model inversion</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><p class="line862">If we want to quantify perfusion in absolute units (ml/100g/min) then the next step is to invert the kinetic model - the model describes how the rate of delivery of labeled blood (and thus perfusion) is related to the measured signal. This can be achieved using <tt class="backtick">oxford_asl</tt> (that makes a call to the <tt class="backtick">basil</tt> command line tool to do the actual model inversion). To do this we now need to know some information about the data, namely: <span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">Labeling was performed using pcASL (thus we need the <tt class="backtick">--casl</tt> option). <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Labelling was performed for 1.4 seconds (<tt class="backtick">--bolus&nbsp;1.4</tt>). <span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span></li><li>The post-labeling delay was 1.5 seconds. <span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span></li></ul><p class="line862">The post-labelling delay corresponds to an 'inversion time' of 2.9 seconds, i.e. 1.4 + 1.5. Thus we set <tt class="backtick">--tis&nbsp;2.9</tt> - this is the list of TIs, where we only have one in this case). Here we have data with only a single delay (and BASIL includes various features for multi-delay data) - <tt class="backtick">oxford_asl</tt> sets a number of other options that are appropriate for single delay data (<tt class="backtick">--artoff&nbsp;--fixbolus</tt>). Note that before FSL 5.0.6 you would need to add the <tt class="backtick">--singleti</tt> option. <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><pre><span class="anchor" id="line-1-1"></span>oxford_asl -i diffdata -o ex1_2 --tis 2.9 --bolus 1.4 --casl</pre><span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><p class="line862">In the <tt class="backtick">ex1_2/native_space</tt> directory you will find the results: a <tt class="backtick">perfusion</tt> image that will look very similar to the one derived in the first exercise, but the magnitude scale will be different. However, this is still only in relative units, we have yet to complete the final step needed to get perfusion in absolute units. <span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><p class="line862">You may also notice an <tt class="backtick">arrival</tt> image, this gives the arterial (bolus) arrival time (in seconds) in every voxel. Since this cannot be estimated from single delay data the image will be uniform and default to 0.7 seconds (or whatever value you choose with the <tt class="backtick">--bat</tt> option). <span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span><p class="line867">
<h3 id="Exercise_1.3:_Calibration">Exercise 1.3: Calibration</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span><p class="line874">To finally get perfusion in absolute units we also need to calculate the equilibrium magnetization of arterial blood and include that in the calculations. Now we need to know some more information about our data. <span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span><ul><li>Background suppression was ON. <span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span></li></ul><p class="line862">This should have improved our perfusion contrast by removing as much static tissue signal as possible. However, we with this cannot use the control images to estimate equilibrium magnetization values. Instead there is a separate dataset, called <tt class="backtick">calib</tt>, which is a series of control images with BGS OFF. We also have <tt class="backtick">calib_body</tt> data in which control images were acquired with the same parameters but using the body coil. We will assume that the latter has a relatively flat sensitivity and use this to correct for sensitivity variation in the coil we used for the main acquisition. At this stage we also supply a structural image - this will be used to segment out the ventricles which will form the basis of our magnetization estimation, plus the perfusion image will also be transformed into the same resolution as the structural image via registration. <span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span><pre><span class="anchor" id="line-1-2"></span>bet data_singleti/struct struct_brain

You should also find <tt class="backtick">ex1_3/structural_space</tt> that has the same results but in a resolution that matches the structural image, the transformation for this process can be found in <tt class="backtick">ex1_3/native_space/asl2struct.mat</tt>. <span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span><p class="line862">The results of the calibration process will be saved in <tt class="backtick">ex1_3/calib</tt>, here you should find <tt class="backtick">M0.txt</tt> which is the estimated M0 value needed to get the perfusion image into absolute units as well as <tt class="backtick">refmask</tt> that you should inspect to check that it looks like the CSF in the ventricles has been selected. For this data it should have worked fine, but if you find data for which this has failed you might need to manually mask a region of CSF in the ventricles and supply that to <tt class="backtick">oxford_asl</tt> using the <tt class="backtick">--csf</tt> option (see the next exercise). <span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span><p class="line862">Note that oxford_asl always uses CSF as a reference for calibration. Other regions and alternative methods are possible and can be accessed through <tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt>, which can be used to calculate an M0 value that can then be applied to the <tt class="backtick">perfusion</tt> image. <span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-61"></span><p class="line867">
<h3 id="Exercise_1.4:_Improving_the_registration_and_other_options">Exercise 1.4: Improving the registration and other options</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span><p class="line874">In the previous example registration was carried out between the raw ASL data and structural image, it should have worked but we would probably like to do better. However, this is a tricky process (due to the low resultion of the ASL data) and is particularly prone to failure if you only have data in which tag-control subtraction has already been done. In the previous example oxford_asl used the calibration image as the basis for registration (if this had not been available it would have used the perfusion image), it is possible to supply another image as the basis for registration: here we will use the mean of the raw data. <span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-65"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span><pre><span class="anchor" id="line-1-3"></span>fslmaths data -Tmean data mean

<span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span>fslmaths data -Tmean datamean</pre><span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span><p class="line874">Like before we will carry out calibration, but to save repeating the identification of the ventricles we will re-use the mask from before. <span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span><p class="line874">Finally, this time we will apply a spatial smoothing prior to the perfusion image. This exploits spatial homogeneity in the perfusion image to improve the estimation, but in an adaptive manner. This is similar to spatially smoothing the data before analysis, but it applies it to the estimated perfusion image and not the data, whilst also estimating the correct degree of spatial smoothing from the data. <span class="anchor" id="line-72"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-73"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-74"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-75"></span><pre><span class="anchor" id="line-1-4"></span>oxford_asl -i diffdata -o ex1_4 --tis 2.9 --bolus 1.4 --casl -c calib --cref calib_body -s struct_brain --csf ex1_3/calib/refmask --regfrom datamean_brain --spatial</pre><span class="anchor" id="line-76"></span><p class="line862">The structure of the results will be the same as in the previous exercise. Compare the two and see what difference the choice of registration basis has made  and the use of the <tt class="backtick">--spatial</tt> option, this should be most clear on the <tt class="backtick">native_space</tt> data. <span class="anchor" id="line-77"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-78"></span><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-79"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-80"></span><p class="line867">
<h1 id="Multi-delay_ASL">Multi-delay ASL</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-81"></span><p class="line862">This tutorial runs through the use of <tt class="backtick">oxford_asl</tt> (the command line tool) on a number of different multi-delay ASL datasets. Examples of pASL, pcASL and QUASAR data are included.

<h2 id="DATASET_1:_pulsed_ASL">DATASET 1: pulsed ASL</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span><p class="line862">This dataset is resting-state ASL data collected using a single-shot three-dimensional GRASE readout, TR/TE 3110/23 ms, 3.44x3.44x5mm, 22 slices using a matrix size 64x64, FAIR preparation, background suppression. Alternating control and tag pairs were acquired with 10 TIs (400, 620, 840, 1060, 1280, 1500, 1720, 1940, 2160, 2380 ms), each one repeated 10 times. The data is in the directory <tt class="backtick">data_pasl</tt>. <span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-91"></span><p class="line862">In this case the tag-control subtraction has already been done and the multiple measurements at each TI have been averaged, this has been put in the file <tt class="backtick">diffdata.nii.gz</tt>.

<h3 id="Exercise_1.1:_CBF_estimation">Exercise 1.1: CBF estimation</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-99"></span><p class="line874">Firstly we are going to do the model-fitting. Try typing this in your terminal <span class="anchor" id="line-100"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-101"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-102"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-103"></span><pre><span class="anchor" id="line-1-6"></span>oxford_asl</pre><span class="anchor" id="line-104"></span><p class="line862">If you call <tt class="backtick">oxford_asl</tt> without any options you get the usage information. There is a lot of functionality (and we do not want to use all of it now), the three main things it can do are: model-fitting, registration and calibration. We need to do model-fitting to get CBF from the multi-TI data, so we will need: <span class="anchor" id="line-105"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-106"></span><ul><li>The tag-control differenced ASL data - we have this already. <span class="anchor" id="line-107"></span></li><li>The TIs that were used to acquire the data - 0.4,0.62,0.84,1.06,1.28,1.5,1.72,1.94,2.16,2.38. <span class="anchor" id="line-108"></span></li><li>The duration of the ASL bolus - the acquisition was FAIR, so the bolus duration is determined by the labelling coil (body). In fact the bolus duration for this data is around 1.1 s, so we will use that value, but allow the model fitting to refine that estimate (this is automatically done by oxford_asl unless we tell it otherwise). <span class="anchor" id="line-109"></span></li><li>A starting guess for the bolus arrival time - we will take the default of 0.7 s, we dont need to be very precise as the model-fitting should work this out for us. <span class="anchor" id="line-110"></span></li><li>Values of T1 and T1b for the field strength we used - data was aquired at 3T so use T1 of 1.3 s and T1b of 1.6 s. <span class="anchor" id="line-111"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-112"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">We have all the information we need so all we have to do is run this command (check you understand what each bit does): <span class="anchor" id="line-113"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-114"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-115"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-116"></span><pre><span class="anchor" id="line-1-7"></span>oxford_asl -i data_pasl/diffdata --tis 0.4,0.62,0.84,1.06,1.28,1.5,1.72,1.94,2.16,2.38 -o ex1_1 --bolus 1.1 --bat 0.7 --t1 1.3 --t1b 1.66 --artoff --spatial</pre><span class="anchor" id="line-117"></span><p class="line862">Notice that we have turned off the estimation of the macrovascular component (<tt class="backtick">--artoff</tt>), we will come back to this.

What we should do, therefore, is to add a macro vascular component to account for this: <span class="anchor" id="line-140"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-141"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-142"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-143"></span><pre><span class="anchor" id="line-1-9"></span>oxford_asl -i data_pasl/diffdata -c aslcalib --csf csfmask --tis 0.4,0.62,0.84,1.06,1.28,1.5,1.72,1.94,2.16,2.38 -o ex1_2 --bolus 1.1 --bat 0.7 --t1 1.3 --t1b 1.66 --spatial</pre><span class="anchor" id="line-144"></span><p class="line862">Notice that we have run exactly the same command as the previous exercise, we have just removed <tt class="backtick">--artoff</tt>.

Alternating control and tag pairs were acquired after 1.4 s of labelling at 5 different post labelling delays (200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 ms), each one repeated 12 times.

As with the pASL results there are perfusion and bolus arrival time images. Since we only have 5 tightly spaced TIs we wont expect our arrival time images to be as good. You will also notice from the arrival time image that the mask generated by oxford_asl wasn't perfect - it includes all the brain, but some non brain too. We could have made our own mask and supplied it to oxford_asl with the <tt class="backtick">-m</tt> option if we had wanted to. It is also worth looking at <tt class="backtick">ex2_2/calib/refmask.nii.gz</tt> as this is the mask that was used to indentify the CSF in the calibration image, you should check that it looks like voxels within the ventricles have been indentified. <span class="anchor" id="line-206"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-207"></span><p class="line874">When we analysed the pASL data we also added a macro vascular component into the model.

<h2 id="DATASET_3:_QUASAR">DATASET 3: QUASAR</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-212"></span><p class="line862">The QUASAR variant of ASL makes use of a combination of flow suppressed and non suppressed multi-TI data to allow for a better separation of the tissue and macro vascular signals. This aids model-based analysis and also permits 'model-free' analysis similar to that used in DSC-MRI. QUASAR data also has all the information within it to do the calibration step. Because the QUASAR sequence is well defined we dont have to worry about all the options in <tt class="backtick">oxford_asl</tt>, in fact there is a special version specifcally desgined for QUASAR data called <tt class="backtick">quasil</tt>.
