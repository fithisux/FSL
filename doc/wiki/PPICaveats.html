<span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-4"></span><p class="line874">This document brings up some issues with PPI that the analysis guys and I are <span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span>concerned about. However, note that lots of papers using PPI have been <span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span>published, and there are always issues with every method, so you shouldn’t get <span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span>too bogged down with these worries. In fact, if you are the <span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span>bogging-down-in-worry type, better stop reading now. <span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="What_exactly_does_PPI_model.3F">What exactly does PPI model?</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><p class="line874">A PPI effect is a task-specific change in correlation between areas, which <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span>cannot be explained simply by a shared effect of task. What neural processes <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span>could generate such a correlation? <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><p class="line874">One answer is probably unmodelled task related variance For example, say that <span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span>in the hypothetical maze-navigation experiment above, we have modelled <span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span>navigation using a block design (navigate/passive travel/rest modelled as <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span>boxcars). What if PFC and HPC (independently) only really get involved in <span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span>navigation when you turn a corner? Then the true shape of the psychological <span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span>variable is rather more phasic than the boxcar we modelled, and thus there is <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span>unmodelled task-related variance shared between the PFC and HPC which could be <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span>driving both areas. This would lead to a spurious PPI. <span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><p class="line874">A second type of unmodelled variance would be learning effects – for example <span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span>in a sequence-tapping task, performance might improve over the course of the <span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span>scanning session, and if this effect is not modelled, it could also drive a <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span>spurious PPI. <span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><p class="line874">Note that whilst the task model we have chosen is ‘partialled out’ of the <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span>data, the unmodelled task variance is not – so in effect the less well our <span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span>model fits the data, the bigger the risk of a spurious PPI… <span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="PET_approach_vs._fMRI_approach">PET approach vs. fMRI approach</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><p class="line874">A PPI approach has been used with PET in many papers (in fact, more than use <span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span>PPI with fMRI). In a PET experiment we only have one data point for each task <span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span>block. This leads to a subtle difference between PET-PPI and fMRI-PPI; in fMRI <span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span>PPI the ‘detailed’ time-course of activation (with on data point per TR) is <span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span>used and indeed in SPM a deconvolution algorithm is employed to make this <span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span>possible. <span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span><p class="line874">It seems to me that, if our data are modelled with a block design, then a <span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span>box-car-like PPI regressor could be used which disregards time-course <span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span>information on a scale faster than the block: after all, if we are proposing <span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span>that the brain processes of interest follow a box-car-like shape, interactions <span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span>of interest should also be box-car-like. I think using this approach would <span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span>improve the interpretability of PPI data, not least because a poor fit of the <span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span>boxcar shape cannot lead to a spurious PPI (as described above) in this case. <span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Deconvolution">Deconvolution</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-61"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span><p class="line874">In order to generate a PPI regressor, we essentially find the product of the <span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span>task regressor and the time-course from the seed region. There is a problem <span class="anchor" id="line-65"></span>with this in that the time course of ‘activity’ in the seed region is actually <span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span>the time-course of the BOLD response and will therefore be shifted in time (by <span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span>the haemodynamic lag) with respect to the task regressor. One way to bring <span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span>these two into line is to convolve the task regressor, but not the <span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span>physiological time-course, with an HRF; this is the approach taken in <span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span>FSL. Another more complicated approach would be to try to deconvolve the <span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span>physiological time-course, to try to find the underlying neuronal time course, <span class="anchor" id="line-72"></span>and multiply this with the not-convolved task regressor; this is the approach <span class="anchor" id="line-73"></span>taken in SPM. <span class="anchor" id="line-74"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-75"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-76"></span><p class="line874">The reason for deconvolving is that the shape or lag of the HRF may be <span class="anchor" id="line-77"></span>different between brain regions, and if no deconvolution is applied, the PPI <span class="anchor" id="line-78"></span>analysis can be biased towards areas with a similar shaped/delayed <span class="anchor" id="line-79"></span>HRF. However, this is only really important for event-related designs; for <span class="anchor" id="line-80"></span>block designs the two methods are roughly equivalent. <span class="anchor" id="line-81"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-82"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-83"></span><p class="line874">A detailed discussion of the deconvolution issue is given in: <span class="anchor" id="line-84"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-85"></span><ul><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">Gitelman DR, Penny WD, Ashburner J, Friston KJ (2003)<br>

But because the psychological, physiological and <span class="anchor" id="line-98"></span>interaction variables are now strongly correlated, the design lacks power.

<span class="anchor" id="line-137"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-138"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-139"></span><p class="line874">PPI is supposed to work better with factorial designs. The reasons for this <span class="anchor" id="line-140"></span>are described in Friston (1997), which I quote here: <span class="anchor" id="line-141"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-142"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-143"></span><ul><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line891"><strong>Factorial Designs  (Friston et al, 1997)</strong> <span class="anchor" id="line-144"></span><em>Psychophysiological interactions generally depend on factorial experimental designs, wherein one can introduce neurophysiological changes in one brain system that are uncorrelated with the stimulus or cognitive context one hopes to see an interaction with. We make this point explicit, suggesting that this is another example of the usefulness of factorial experiments: Although it is possible to test for psychophysiological interactions in almost any experimental design, the use of factorial designs ensures that any psychophysiological interactions will be detected with a fair degree of sensitivity. This is because the activities in the source area, the psychological context, and the interaction between them, will be roughly orthogonal and therefore one can use the first two as confounds with impunity. The converse situation, in which only one stimulus or cognitive factor has been changed, may render the activity in the source area and changes in the factor correlated. If this is the case, there is no guarantee that the interaction will be independent of either and its effect may be difficult to detect in the presence of the ‘‘main effects.’’</em> <span class="anchor" id="line-145"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-146"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-147"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">This makes sense in some ways, but to me it seems strange – surely the only <span class="anchor" id="line-148"></span>reason this works is that you are including psychological variables which <span class="anchor" id="line-149"></span>differ from the contrast of interest, which would after all be the interaction <span class="anchor" id="line-150"></span>contrast 1, -1/3, -1/3, -1/3 ? <span class="anchor" id="line-151"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-152"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-153"></span><p class="line874">In other words, if we have a factorial design the psychological, physiological <span class="anchor" id="line-154"></span>and interaction regressors will be relatively orthogonal.

Then we might define a seed voxel for our PPI which is active in the <span class="anchor" id="line-158"></span>GLM contrast familiar-novel (perhaps in the medial temporal lobe), and analyse <span class="anchor" id="line-159"></span>the PPI in the visual condition (perhaps we think visual cortex will show a <span class="anchor" id="line-160"></span>stronger functional connection with medial temporal lobe in the familiar <span class="anchor" id="line-161"></span>condition).
