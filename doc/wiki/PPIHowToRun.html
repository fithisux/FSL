If you don’t have a clear hypothesis about functional <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span>connectivity, you might consider using a model-free approach like MELODIC, <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span>which also gives you ‘network’ information of a different kind. On the other <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span>hand, you can also try running lots of different PPIs with different seed <span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span>regions until you find something interesting…. <span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><p class="line867">
<h3 id="Choose_your_ROI">Choose your ROI</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><p class="line874">For a PPI analysis, you must select a seed Region of Interest (ROI) – the <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span>point of the analysis is to look for areas which ‘interact’ with this seed <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span>region. <span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><p class="line874">There are several types of ROI you might go for: <span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><ul><li><p class="line891"><strong>An anatomical region of interest.</strong> For example, you might have an a priori hypothesis about the functional connectivity, in your task, of the hippocampus, or the putamen, or some other region which you can define from a structural scan. <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span></li><li class="gap"><p class="line891"><strong>An ROI based on functional activations from your initial GLM (Feat) analysis.</strong>  For example, you might find a few blobs associated with your task of interest, and you hypothesis that these blobs can be grouped into a couple of separate networks. Maybe you were doing a memory task, and it activated the hippocampus. You have some idea what the hippocampus is doing, so now you want to know which areas have increased functional connectivity with it during your task, and which areas are involved, but not interacting with the hippocampus. <span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span></li><li class="gap"><p class="line891"><strong>An ROI based on a local maximum in one of your MELODIC components.</strong> For example, say you analyzed your data with group-MELODIC and you found the two biggest components were, say, an attentional (dorsal, frontal-parietal) network and a memory network (say, prefrontal and medial temporal areas). And say your experiment looked at how your memories can bias your attention, comparing trials with familiar stimuli and novel stimuli. Then the attention and memory networks might describe the two major cognitive components of your whole dataset (all trials together) - but for you the critical point of interest is whether there is more interaction between networks in your attention-from-memory task. You can pick a blob from one of your melodic components, which you think might be the 'linking' node, and use it as the seed for a PPI, which tells you about task-specific interactions.  Note that MELODIC blobs may be more likely to be 'good' seeds for your PPI analysis than GLM/Feat blobs, because MELODIC is a more network-oriented type of analysis. <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><p class="line874">PPI analysis always looks for voxels with increased functional connectivity to <span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span>your seed ROI in one condition compared to another. Usually, the contrast will <span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span>be between conditions within a single scanning session, and you need to decide <span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span>whether this will be a contrast of one condition vs everything else (a 1 0 <span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span>contrast) or a contrast between two conditions (a 1 -1 contrast).

If in doubt, have a look at the notes on orthogonalizing in the main Feat page and the FSL course.  Effectively, orthogonalizing means that the stats for the EV you orthogonalize <em>with respect to</em> (<strong>not</strong> the EV where you click the 'orthogonalize' button) change. Why? Because in the GLM, if some activity in your voxel is correlated with BOTH EVs A and B, is is not assigned to either. Now, If A and B are partially correlated (eg if they are your PSY and PPI) then some activity in some voxels may be correlated with the correlated part of A and B. This activity is therefore assigned to neither A nor B. Orthogonalizing B with respect to A changes regressor B, to remove the part which was correlated with A. This means that the activity which was correlated with both A and B, which was previously not modelled, is now only correlated with A - so the estimate for EV A changes. The esitmate for EV B stays the same, because you have only taken away the part of that EV which was correlated with A, and therefore didn't get any activity assigned to it anyway. Now, in Feat you always orthogonalize the later-created EV w.r.t. the earlier-created one, and the PPI EV will necessarily be created after the task EV- So if you were to orthogonalise your PPI EV with respect to your task EV, the effect of orthogonalizing would be on the results for the main effect of task, not on the PPI effect. <span class="anchor" id="line-160"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Switch off <strong>temporal derivative</strong> and <strong>temporal filtering</strong> <span class="anchor" id="line-161"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-162"></span><ul><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line891"><img alt="PPI within subjects setup" class="attachment" src="attachments/PPIHowToRun/PPI_setup_within_subjects_design.png" title="PPI within subjects setup" /> <span class="anchor" id="line-163"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-164"></span></li></ul></li><li class="gap"><p class="line891"><strong>Other task regressors</strong> As well as the three EVs described here, you should include all the task EVs you included in your original model, in the setup for the PPI analysis. So your setup should look like the setup for your original (standard) Feat analysis, but with the physiological and PPI regressors added. The model describes the data better if all task EVs are included. <span class="anchor" id="line-165"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-166"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-167"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">This completes the set-up for the first-level analysis.
