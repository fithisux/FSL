FLAME uses very sophisticated methods for modelling and estimating the random-effects component of the measured inter-session mixed-effects variance, using MCMC to get an accurate estimation of the true random-effects variance and degrees of freedom at each voxel. <span class="anchor" id="line-118"></span></li><li>Slice timing correction <span class="anchor" id="line-119"></span></li><li>Basis function HRF convolutions <span class="anchor" id="line-120"></span></li><li>Pre-threshold masking <span class="anchor" id="line-121"></span></li><li>Contrast masking after thresholding <span class="anchor" id="line-122"></span></li><li>Optionally registration can use two structural images as well as standard space image. <span class="anchor" id="line-123"></span></li><li>Peristimulus timing plots in the web report. <span class="anchor" id="line-124"></span></li><li>Featquery - a program which allows you to interrogate FEAT results by defining a mask or co-ordinates (in standard-space, highres-space or lowres-space) and get mean stats values and time-series. <span class="anchor" id="line-125"></span></li><li>Although IRVA (semi-model-free analysis) is still bundled with FSL, it is no longer an option within FEAT. This is because this kind of analysis is effectively covered as a subset of the functionality of FIR basis function analysis in FEAT. <span class="anchor" id="line-126"></span></li></ul></li><li>MELODIC v2: <span class="anchor" id="line-127"></span><ul><li>Probabilistic ICA (PICA) for FMRI. By adding a Gaussian noise model to the ICA model, and automatically estimating the dimensionality (the number of non-Gaussian components), it is now possible to create meaningful Z-statistic maps for each spatial component, allowing inference ("thresholding"). <span class="anchor" id="line-128"></span></li><li>Inference on the Z-statistic images is carried out with a Gaussian/Gamma mixture model (fitted using EM), fitting central noise and activation classes; thus alternative hypothesis testing is used. <span class="anchor" id="line-129"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Interoperation with <a href="./FreeSurfer.html">FreeSurfer</a> - it is now very easy to display FEAT results onto <a href="./FreeSurfer.html">FreeSurfer</a>-generated inflated or flattened surfaces, and also easy to carry out group FEAT analysis in standard-spherical-surface space instead of 3D standard space. <span class="anchor" id="line-130"></span></li><li>Interoperation with AFNI - AFNI can now easily read FSL (particularly FEAT) output for easy visualisation. <span class="anchor" id="line-131"></span></li></ul></li><li>SIENA v2: increased accuracy by forcing all steps to be symmetric; added masking functionality including standard-space-based Z limits. <span class="anchor" id="line-132"></span></li><li><p class="line862">FLIRT&MCFLIRT; now run on single-slice (or few-slice) data; the flirt -applyxfm option now allows the processing of 4D data; new GUIs - ApplyXFM, ConcatXFM. <span class="anchor" id="line-133"></span></li><li>BET: new command-line options for surface initialisation; "bet" now runs on binarised and on 2D images; the "betpremask" script uses FLIRT registration to do standard-space masking instead of running "bet"; bet now works on 4D images in two possible ways (the "betfunc" script is suited to motion-corrected FMRI data, applying over-inclusive masking, whilst just running "bet" on 4D data estimates the brain mask from the first image and applies this to the rest); <span class="anchor" id="line-134"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-135"></span>

<span class="anchor" id="line-140"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-141"></span><ul><li>New: MELODIC - ICA-based model-free analysis of FMRI (and other 4D) data. <span class="anchor" id="line-142"></span></li><li>New: FAST - Brain segmentation (into different tissue types) and bias field correction. <span class="anchor" id="line-143"></span></li><li>New: FUGUE - Unwarps geometric distortion in EPI images using B0 field maps. <span class="anchor" id="line-144"></span></li><li>New: SIENA - Structural brain change analysis, for estimating brain atrophy. <span class="anchor" id="line-145"></span></li><li>FEAT 4.03: new features include F-tests and improved organisation of GLM-setup GUI. <span class="anchor" id="line-146"></span></li><li>FLIRT: new features include image masking/weighting, different output interpolations, and allowing 2D registration. <span class="anchor" id="line-147"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-148"></span>

<h2 id="Release_1.2.2C_December_2000:">Release 1.2, December 2000:</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-152"></span><ul><li>All GUIs can now run standalone - i.e., nothing in FSL needs MEDx in order to run. <span class="anchor" id="line-153"></span></li><li>FSL now includes MCFLIRT motion correction, which is more accurate, and faster, than the other tested MC methods. FEAT uses MCFLIRT only. <span class="anchor" id="line-154"></span></li><li>FILM (the GLM method inside FEAT) now uses general least-squares, prewhitening the data before the final fitting. This gives more efficient activation estimation than the other methods tested, particularly for dense single-event experiments. It includes autocorrelation correction, using smoothing of autocorrelation coefficients and nonlinear spatial filtering to achieve robust estimation. <span class="anchor" id="line-155"></span></li><li>A new GUI "fsl" which calls the other main FSL tools. <span class="anchor" id="line-156"></span></li><li>The "model-free ANOVA" method has been renamed "IRVA" (Inter-Repetition Variance Analysis) to avoid later confusion with ICA truly model-free analysis (to be released shortly). <span class="anchor" id="line-157"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-158"></span>
<h2 id="Release_1.1.2C_August_2000:">Release 1.1, August 2000:</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-159"></span><ul><li>FEAT (FMRI analysis) will now use FLIRT (registration) to automatically register your FMRI data to a high-resolution structural and/or standard image for you, without having to use the FLIRT GUI separately. <span class="anchor" id="line-160"></span></li><li>FEAT can now run group statistics (fixed-effects and random-effects) across groups of FEAT directories, either in a single long FEAT run (consisting of multiple first-level analyses followed by group-stats) or on previously created FEAT directories. <span class="anchor" id="line-161"></span></li><li>You can now explicitly demand that certain EVs in FEAT be orthogonalised with respect to other EVs in the design matrix. <span class="anchor" id="line-162"></span></li><li>FSL now works with both the latest MEDx release (3.30) and the previous version (3.20). <span class="anchor" id="line-163"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-164"></span>
